            Lottopool is the capstone project I submitted for my Computer Science degree. Myself and four others worked 
            together to create this webapp consisting of a Typescript frontend, Python backend, and MariaDB Database; 
            all compiled and served via two Docker images. It also includes automated testing, building, and 
            distribution via GitHub Actions.

            Canvas2 is a recreation of the Canvas LMS software that I designed with a team for my Advanced Python class.
            Under the hood, it uses Flask and MongoDB. Canvas2 includes a basic plagarism detection algorithm by 
            implementing simhashes and the Jaccard Similarity formula. Lastly, it also includes automated testing,
            building, and distribution via GitHub Actions.

            As a fun side-project and a means to keep my programming skills fresh, I now develop plugins for the 
            critically acclaimed MMO <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> in my free time! This hobby started with MapGilTracker, a
            plugin I developed in collaboration with my FC that helps keep track of gil rewarded from Treasure Map runs.
            These plugins are all written in C# and compiled/distributed via GitHub Actions.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/Azure-Agst/classbot-3.0">Class Enrollment Automation Suite</a></h3>
            Classbot is a tool that I worked on throughout my time as an FSU student, which automates the enrollment
            procedure for students. Written in Python and utilizing the Selenium driver, Classbot helped myself
            and several others get into congested classes that would have set us behind schedule had we not gotten in.
            It is now open-source and available for any student to use or modify for their own use case!

            My latest endeavor in the world of cloud computing! I now have a little server sandbox in my closet
            to mess around with! On said the rack lives a WRT1200AC, Synology RS816, M93p Tiny, and a few Mac
            Minis which are all configured in one big K3S kubernetes cluster. This cluster hosts a lot of software
            in use by my home network including PiHole, Lancache, and various backup softwares.
