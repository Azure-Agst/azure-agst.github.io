        <h3>A statement regarding Hurricane Ian</h3>

        <p>Hey everyone!</p>
        <p>Some of you may be here because of the notification bar at the top of my websites, or maybe you've been forcefully redirected because some of my services are down. Regardless, If you haven't heard yet, the state of Florida is about to be bombarded with a pretty gnarly Hurricane.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/163741_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind.png">
        <p>This includes where I live/work, and everyone I know is taking this pretty seriously. Plans are being cancelled, my uni has called off classes through the week, and the entire city's in prep mode.</p>
        <p>If you're unaware, all of my services are hosted on my hybrid cloud, with the heart of it being the K3S cluster in my closet. Posts, a bunch of my bots, and all of my automations are hosted off of this cluster. With the storm on my state's doorstep, I fully expect to be without power for longer than my UPS can keep things alive, so I'll be preemptively shutting my servers down during this time. The only service that will be available for the next few days is my resume website, which you're on right now.</p>
        <p>If accessing the contents of my blog is of the utmost importance, I have backed up a few select articles on the wayback machine, which you may access at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220925160459/https%3A%2F%2Fposts.azureagst.dev%2F">this link</a>.</p>
        <p>I should be fine, this isn't my first hurricane. I'm more worried about my family than I am about myself. If you'd like to help out, I would highly suggest looking up relief funds after the storm hits and donating to them. Red Cross is probably a good starting point, but keep an eye out on social media for local funds that need  your help more.</p>
        <p>Everything will be back in full swing as soon as it's possible to bring stuff back online. If you have any questions or concerns, the email on my homepage is always open. I appreciate your understanding during these times. Be safe and well!</p>
